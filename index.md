## About Me

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Music Technology at McGill University, Montreal. My PhD research involves developing physics-based sound synthesis models for free reed instruments, and designing an interface & controller for a novel digital harmonium based on the synthesis models. 

I am also a professional-level harmonium player in the Hindustani (North Indian) Classical tradition. 

I strongly believe that technology can help us provide an additional perspective to understand, appreciate and even create music. 

<!-- The diversity in my experiences and achievements in the fields of mechanical engineering, signal processing, computer programming, teaching, entrepreneurship as well as live music performances has A unique amalgamation of these skills greatly helps me in delivering audio and music technology projects. -->
